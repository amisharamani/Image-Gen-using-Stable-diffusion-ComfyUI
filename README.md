## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
#### Hardware Requirements
- **CPU**: Modern multi-core processor (Intel/AMD).
- **RAM**: 8GB or higher.
- **GPU** (Recommended): NVIDIA GPU with ‚â•4GB VRAM for accelerated performance.

#### Software Requirements
- **ComfyUI**: [Download ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI)
- **Stable Diffusion Model**: [Download v1-5-pruned-emaonly-fp16.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/stable-diffusion-v15-archive/blob/main/v1-5-pruned-emaonly-fp16.safetensors)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Step 1: Extract ComfyUI
1. Download the `ComfyUI_windows_portable.zip` file from the [ComfyUI GitHub](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI).
2. Extract the ZIP file to a folder of your choice.

### Step 2: Place the Stable Diffusion Model
1. Navigate to the extracted folder:  
   `ComfyUI_windows_portable ‚Üí ComfyUI ‚Üí models ‚Üí checkpoints`
2. Place the downloaded Stable Diffusion model (`v1-5-pruned-emaonly-fp16.safetensors`) into the `checkpoints` folder.

### Step 3: Run ComfyUI
1. Go back to the `ComfyUI_windows_portable` directory.
2. Choose the appropriate batch file:
   - **For GPU (NVIDIA)**: Double-click `run_nvidia_gpu.bat`  
     *(Recommended for faster performance)*
   - **For CPU-only**: Double-click `run_cpu.bat`
3. Wait for the server to start. A browser window will open automatically at `http://127.0.0.1:8188`.

## üñºÔ∏è Usage
1. **Enter a Prompt**: Type your text description in the input field (e.g., "A mystical waterfall in a tropical rainforest").
2. **Generate Image**: Click "Generate" to create the image.
3. **Adjust Parameters** (Optional): Modify sampling steps, CFG scale, or negative prompts for better results.
4. **Download**: Save the generated image to your device.
